## <span style="color:red"> 1. A little about myself </span>

I have been passionate about programming since I was 15 years old. I remember how fun it was to write my first "Hello World!" in java.

I could spend hours and hours in front of the computer ðŸ’» without even seeing time pass.

I have a lot to thank Etec from Ilha Solteira and the excellent teachers for giving me an excellent foundation of programming logic, java, C, C#, pascal and SQL.
