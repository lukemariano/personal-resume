> “We’re here to put a dent in the universe. Otherwise why else even be here?” - Steve Jobs

Hello👋, my name is Lucas Mariano da Silva and I'm 20 years old.

The quote above describes well one of my main motivations, which is related to being able to one day be part of a big project and be able to leave my mark on the world.

This means that I consider myself a person who really likes challenges (and pizza). I like the feeling of always being on the move, learning new things, traveling to different places and making new friends. After all, to live is to be on the move🧗🏽
 
## <span style="color:red"> 1.1 My first contact with technology 👨‍💻 </span>
I have been passionate about programming since I was 15 years old. I remember how fun it was to write my first "Hello World!" in java.

I could spend hours and hours in front of the computer 💻 without even seeing time pass.

I have a lot to thank Etec from Ilha Solteira and the excellent teachers for giving me an excellent foundation of programming logic, java, C, C#, pascal and SQL.

At the end of 2021, I participated in a selection process by the company Buser regarding a [program to train fullstack developers.](https://blog.buser.com.br/novidades/buser-lanca-programa-capacitacao-profissionais-tecnologia/)

The program's objective is to combine academic knowledge with learning that is obtained on a day-to-day basis as a developer in the company, hands-on. With BuserTech, theory and practice will be aligned from the beginning.

After a rigorous selection process with more than 5,000 candidates, I was among the 40 selected and I have been in the program for 9 months, working especially in the data science area, solving real problems on a daily basis, delivering results and contributing to the development of the company. It has been an amazing experience!
