> “We’re here to put a dent in the universe. Otherwise why else even be here?” - Steve Jobs

Hello👋, my name is Lucas Mariano da Silva and I'm 20 years old.

The quote above describes well one of my main motivations, which is related to being able to one day be part of a big project and be able to leave my mark on the world.

This means that I consider myself a person who really likes challenges (and pizza). I like the feeling of always being on the move, learning new things, traveling to different places and making new friends. After all, to live is to be on the move🧗🏽
 
## <span style="color:red"> 1.1 My first contact with technology 👨‍💻 </span>
I have been passionate about programming since I was 15 years old. I remember how fun it was to write my first "Hello World!" in java.

I could spend hours and hours in front of the computer 💻 without even seeing time pass.
